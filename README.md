# gol-cpp

A simple, modern C++ implementation of **Conway’s Game of Life**.  
This CLI-based version prints each generation to your terminal, so you can watch the simulation evolve over time.

## Build & Run

```bash
# From project root:
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./gol_cpp
````

The simulation will run in your terminal, continuously updating the grid.

---

## How It Works

The simulation follows the classic **Game of Life rules**:

1. **Birth** → A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.
2. **Survival** → A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive.
3. **Death** → A live cell with fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors dies.

Cells are displayed using **Unicode block characters** to make the output denser and more visually appealing:

* `█` → both cells alive
* `▀` → top cell alive
* `▄` → bottom cell alive
* (space) → both cells dead

---

## Example Output

When you run the program, you’ll see an evolving grid in your terminal:

```
 ▀▄ █▀  ▀█  █▄
█▀▄▀█▄ ▀▄█▀ █▀
  ▀█▄▀ █▄▀▄█▄ 
█▄█ ▄▀▀▄▀ █▀▄
```

The patterns will evolve continuously according to Conway’s rules.
